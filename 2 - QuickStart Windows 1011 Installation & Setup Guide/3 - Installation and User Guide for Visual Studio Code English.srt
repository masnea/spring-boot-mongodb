1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,450
‫Before you start this set up installation guide, we're making the assumption that you have Python installed.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,830
‫If you don't, then check out the previous tutorial where we take you through those steps.

3
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:12,700
‫In this course.

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,890
‫Our preferred code editor is Visual Studio Code.

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:20,140
‫All the examples in this course will be presented utilizing this software.

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,170
‫Although it's completely optional what code editor you choose.

7
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:28,550
‫We do recommend that you follow along with this course with Visual Studio Code.

8
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:36,320
‫So let's start by browsing or searching for Visual Studio Code.

9
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,280
‫We can use the keyword download as well.

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,450
‫That can be handy.

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,770
‫That should take us to code Visual Studio download.

12
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,500
‫So let's go over to that web page.

13
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,370
‫Looks a little bit like this, except that.

14
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,890
‫So from here you can see that we've got multiple options.

15
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:58,600
‫Visual Studio Code can be installed and used on multiple operating systems.

16
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,370
‫Now, assuming that you have a computer that's been purchased over the last ten years, the likelihood

17
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:07,000
‫is that you're running a 64 bit operating system.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,360
‫So you can select these 64 bit set up installer here, this 64 bit option here, or you can just go

19
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,680
‫ahead and select this Windows download, whichever one you decide.

20
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,030
‫That should be absolutely fine.

21
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:24,490
‫So this download here is going to be a universal installer for Windows eight, ten and 11.

22
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,220
‫Okay, so I'm clicking on that page.

23
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,170
‫You can see that we've started downloading, so that would take a couple of seconds and then we can

24
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:34,860
‫start.

25
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,860
‫So let's quickly run through the installation wizard here.

26
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,930
‫So accept the agreement.

27
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,220
‫Press Next, you can decide where you want to install Visual Studio code.

28
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,890
‫I don't recommend that you change the installation settings there unless you have some specific setup

29
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:50,880
‫on your computer.

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,760
‫So just next, the Start menu folder.

31
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,630
‫Just next.

32
00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:01,200
‫And then let's create a desktop icon that can be handy and add to path that is always going to be handy

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,030
‫so we can utilize a terminal effectively as press next and install.

34
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:12,630
‫Once you've finished installing Visual Studio Code, go ahead and open up Visual Studio Code.

35
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,660
‫I'm just going to take you through a few different settings that you can apply and give you a basic

36
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,350
‫introduction to Visual Studio Code if you're completely new to this.

37
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,160
‫So first of all, we need to select what we want it to look like.

38
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,260
‫So I'm just going to select the dark option here.

39
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,080
‫Next selection here.

40
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:36,990
‫There isn't really anything here that we need to consider, so let's just close that tab.

41
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,290
‫Right?

42
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,970
‫So first of all, if we want to create a new project with Visual Studio Code or if you want to work

43
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:47,070
‫with the project, then we generally open up the folder and work within that folder.

44
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:52,830
‫So what we're going to need to do here very briefly is let's go over to a desktop here.

45
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,050
‫Let's just create a new folder.

46
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,230
‫Let's just call this project.

47
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,670
‫So generally you have a project folder, that's the folder where your project is being developed, all

48
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,510
‫the files, etc. is going to be in that folder.

49
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:12,060
‫So generally when we open up a new Visual Studio code window or project, the first step is to open

50
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,590
‫the folder.

51
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,850
‫We can do that by the left hand side.

52
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:19,860
‫Here we have the Explorer tab here or you can go to file and then open folder.

53
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,320
‫So we just need to select the folder, our project folder, and now we have the project folder on the

54
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,220
‫left hand side here.

55
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,040
‫So we're interacting with that folder we just created on the desktop.

56
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:37,350
‫So if we were to create a new file, so all python files have the PY file extension, you can see we've

57
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,460
‫created a new file there.

58
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:44,670
‫So if I go back to the folder we created on the desktop, you can see that that folder now has that

59
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,810
‫file we've just created so you can see how that's interacting with that folder.

60
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:49,440
‫All right.

61
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,430
‫So that's my project.

62
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:55,080
‫And the idea here is that we click on the file, it appears on the right hand side here, we can start

63
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,370
‫writing some code.

64
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,820
‫You can see that Visual Studio code uses a TAB system.

65
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:05,880
‫So when we open up new files, you'll be able to access those files from the top ribbon ribbon here.

66
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:06,750
‫So.

67
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,410
‫On the right hand side.

68
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,630
‫This can be pretty handy here.

69
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,250
‫We can split the screen so you can work on two files.

70
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:18,630
‫That's pretty handy if you're working with multiple files, and we can close that.

71
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,730
‫So go ahead and close the file.

72
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,960
‫That would then close that additional window.

73
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,580
‫So you notice here and it's very small at the moment or maybe on your screen, but you can see a dot

74
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,490
‫next to the name with the file that we've opened.

75
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,780
‫That DOT represents the fact that the file has not been saved.

76
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,880
‫Now, one of the common problems that I find students fall into at the start is they forget to save

77
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,780
‫their files.

78
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,700
‫Now, I recommend that you go over to file and you select Auto Save.

79
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,090
‫So just click on Auto Save and that will just auto save.

80
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:56,430
‫Now all the files so you'd never have to press save any time you type something, it would just automatically

81
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:56,910
‫save.

82
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,590
‫And that can be really handy.

83
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:07,250
‫Something else that you'll probably want to do is to zoom in or utilize the will mouse to zoom in.

84
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:13,040
‫So if you go over to file and then preferences and then settings, that's where you're going to find

85
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,900
‫all the settings for Visual Studio code.

86
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:20,180
‫But if I type in, zoom into this search bar up top here, I can select Zoom.

87
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:28,940
‫And now what I can do is I can easily zoom when holding the control key and my mouse if I can find the

88
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,990
‫control key.

89
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:30,380
‫Of course.

90
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:30,950
‫There we go.

91
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,810
‫So there we go.

92
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,990
‫So it makes it a lot easier for you to zoom in and out, which can be very handy.

93
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:42,410
‫In addition to that, if you hold down control and press plus and minus on your keyboard, you can actually

94
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:46,760
‫scale the whole UI of Visual Studio code.

95
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:54,070
‫The last feature, which is going to be utilized on this course is the terminal.

96
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:59,050
‫Now, if I dragged from the bottom just before the blue bar at the bottom, you can't see that, but

97
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,150
‫you can kind of see where my mouse is ended here.

98
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:01,980
‫Just here.

99
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,170
‫The new arrow appears up and down.

100
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,790
‫Our appears when it's available.

101
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:11,050
‫And it means I can drag up and I can drag this terminal up with my mouse here.

102
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,330
‫So this opens up the terminal.

103
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,930
‫This is really handy feature that we're going to be utilizing throughout this course.

104
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,630
‫And generally when you're working with Django or Python.

105
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:26,040
‫The terminal is normally needed for some reason, so I can access that terminal by dragging it up.

106
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:30,610
‫Now there is a shortcut if I go to view, you can see here, we're told in the terminal I need to press

107
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:38,940
‫control plus and it looks like a left single quote that is a shortcut to bring the terminal up and down.

108
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:44,050
‫So control plus I think I have it on this keyboard.

109
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,220
‫I'm using a mac keyboard now.

110
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,120
‫It's not going to work.

111
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,450
‫Okay, So on your keyboard, you can type in your shortcut.

112
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,580
‫Now, let me just zoom back out again.

113
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:52,300
‫Okay?

114
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:58,300
‫So if you do want to remove the terminal, there is a bin here which I click and then that removes the

115
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,270
‫terminal and closes the terminal window.

116
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:05,830
‫So just make sure that you feel comfortable opening and closing the terminal wherever you drag or wherever

117
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,240
‫you use the shortcut.

118
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:13,870
‫I do recommend that you spend maybe five, 10 minutes just familiarizing yourself with Visual Studio

119
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,590
‫Code because it can make following the tutorials much easier.
