1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,130
‫When working with Python and Visual Studio Code, the likelihood is that you're going to be working

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,110
‫within virtual environments.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,840
‫When you download Python, it comes with all the tools to allow you to start virtual environments on

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,770
‫your computer.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,500
‫In this tutorial we focus on the process.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,060
‫So do try and move away from asking yourself lots of questions.

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,800
‫Why do I need a virtual environment?

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,270
‫What is a virtual environment?

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,360
‫And just focus on the process at this point?

10
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,030
‫Within your course Core content.

11
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:37,190
‫Additional information regarding the virtual environment will be provided if appropriate.

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,720
‫Before you start this process, you will need Visual Studio code and Python installed.

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,780
‫So here on Windows, we've already installed Visual Studio Code.

14
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,110
‫Check out the previous tutorials if you haven't already done so.

15
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,010
‫All right.

16
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,360
‫So here we have a project.

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,470
‫It's automatically opened up my project, so let's just go through that process again.

18
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,040
‫So the first thing we want to do.

19
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,680
‫File open a folder, open the project that we want to work with.

20
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,000
‫So we have a project folder on the desktop.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,790
‫We've opened that up and you can see that we have this file.

22
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,060
‫Okay, so now we want to build a virtual environment.

23
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:16,840
‫Like I mentioned, when we download Python, one of the tools that it comes with is the virtual environment.

24
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:25,510
‫So we can go ahead and type PI for Python and then we can use the RM flag VM V to start the actual virtual

25
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:25,990
‫environment.

26
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,340
‫And then we need to then pass in the name of the folder.

27
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,080
‫So this folder can be absolutely anything.

28
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,840
‫So let's just call this VM V.

29
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,940
‫So this command will then start a new virtual environment.

30
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:43,750
‫You can see that we've created a folder with lots of other information or folders and files inside of

31
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,350
‫that.

32
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,320
‫To start to paint a picture of what's going on here.

33
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,690
‫Imagine your computer is a box.

34
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,980
‫When we download Python, Python is installed in that box.

35
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:59,390
‫If we wanted to run python, we could run python from that box.

36
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,920
‫Our operating system.

37
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:07,730
‫Now, the problem is here, when we start working on multiple projects, each project may require a

38
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,920
‫different additional software.

39
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:16,340
‫So for example, one project might be utilizing Django, maybe Django four, and one project might be

40
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,240
‫utilizing Django 3.2 and an earlier version of Django.

41
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:27,890
‫Now, the problem is here in our main box, if we were to install Django four and Django 3.2, for example,

42
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,210
‫in the same box, potentially we would have conflicts.

43
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:38,020
‫So the whole idea here of a virtual environment is that we make smaller boxes inside of our big box.

44
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:44,420
‫So we create virtual environments within our computer, within that virtual environment we install or

45
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:50,120
‫we have Python available and we can install additional software inside of that smaller box.

46
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:54,470
‫That way we can encapsulate everything that the project requires.

47
00:02:54,470 --> 00:03:01,760
‫That particular project requires inside of that smaller box without conflicting or damaging or changing

48
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,940
‫the main big box, our main operating system.

49
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:12,260
‫So we're working within a smaller box, within the bigger box here, and that allows us to create specific

50
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,790
‫environments for specific projects that we're working within.

51
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,900
‫So what we've done here is we've created our virtual environment.

52
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:23,210
‫Now what we need to do is we need to activate it.

53
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:27,790
‫So on Windows, we just need to type in V Now I'm going to press tab here.

54
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,710
‫Notice that it's going to end the it's not going to end it.

55
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,370
‫It's going to end the command.

56
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:42,080
‫So V And then I press tab and you can see here finishes off the line and that references the folder

57
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,130
‫here inside of here we have a folder called Scripts.

58
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,860
‫So inside of this folder we have scripts, so we're just navigating this folder system here.

59
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:52,130
‫I press tab and then I need to activate.

60
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:59,210
‫So inside of scripts we have activate and I press tab to finish off that line or that command and press

61
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,430
‫enter and you can see that we have a problem.

62
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:08,400
‫Not everyone will experience this problem, but we need to change some of the settings to allow us to

63
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,590
‫actually start a virtual environment.

64
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:18,390
‫If you received this issue here, we just need to configure the execution policies on your computer.

65
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,970
‫Now, there's a few different ways of doing this.

66
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:25,510
‫If you go over to Stack Overflow like I previously mentioned in the previous tutorial.

67
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,900
‫Good place to resolve any issues that we might have.

68
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:33,640
‫There are a few different methods of doing this, so let's just follow this one here.

69
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:41,440
‫So we need to set execution policy and restricted scope process as mentioned in the section in your

70
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,970
‫PowerShell window.

71
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,250
‫So we need to open up a PowerShell window.

72
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,010
‫So let's go to start, let's type in PowerShell.

73
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:53,350
‫Now we're going to need to open up a PowerShell window to again PowerShell window.

74
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,870
‫We are going to need to do that as administrator.

75
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,800
‫So I right click and then I select run as administrator.

76
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,100
‫So that's going to open up PowerShell as an administrator.

77
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:09,610
‫So now what we can do is we can run this command, so set dash execution policy and restrict escape

78
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,540
‫process.

79
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,220
‫So I'm going to copy that.

80
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,970
‫This link will be available in the in the resources of this tutorial.

81
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,710
‫So let's go ahead and paste that in, give that a go.

82
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:28,510
‫So I need to now press Y or A to yes to Oh so I type in Capital A and press enter and there we go.

83
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,530
‫So now what we need to do is we just need to close Visual Studio code.

84
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,500
‫This is a step that some forget or don't do, and we can then go ahead and just open up Visual Studio

85
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,970
‫code once again.

86
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,070
‫I think there's a shortcut on my desktop for that.

87
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,100
‫And now let's go through the process again.

88
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,870
‫So the virtual environment is still there.

89
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:54,810
‫Whenever we start a new, whenever we come back to our project, you can see that the folder that was

90
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:59,140
‫the path here correlates to the folder of our project.

91
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,520
‫So we're inside of this folder.

92
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,940
‫So if I type in, let's just clear this.

93
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,300
‫So I type in clear and enter to clear the screen.

94
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,630
‫If I type in LRS, we can see that that shows me the current folder that I'm working within because

95
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,470
‫I can see the files and folders that correlate to my project here.

96
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,090
‫So I press clear again.

97
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:23,190
‫Now I can just press up that brings, brings up the previous commands up and down.

98
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,950
‫So I give that a go that makes things a little bit easier.

99
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,490
‫So I clear the screen again.

100
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:31,530
‫So let's now start or try to activate our virtual environment again.

101
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:38,550
‫So here I'm going to type in V press tab, then Capital S tab A tab.

102
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,540
‫And there we go.

103
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,150
‫So you can see that that method did not work.

104
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,920
‫So that familiarize yourself with the process if you like.

105
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,460
‫So let's go back into the PowerShell.

106
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,390
‫Let's try again.

107
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,210
‫PowerShell.

108
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,060
‫Right click.

109
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,250
‫Run as administrator Press.

110
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:53,850
‫Yes.

111
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:59,010
‫And let's go ahead and press and type in set execution policy.

112
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,920
‫I'm restricted and then dash force.

113
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,500
‫So that's what we're going to run here.

114
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:11,160
‫Okay, so I've just changed the scale of my font here so you can actually see the command.

115
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,720
‫That should make it a lot easier for it.

116
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,880
‫So let's press enter there and let's now give this a go.

117
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,910
‫So I'm restricted force so there are no messages here.

118
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:24,090
‫So let's go back into Visual Studio Code.

119
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,970
‫Let's go ahead and close the PowerShell.

120
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:31,800
‫Let's open this up again, view terminal and then let's give this a go again.

121
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,050
‫So I just press up here twice to the command to activate virtual environment.

122
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:37,740
‫You can type it in.

123
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:44,430
‫Of course I press enter and you can see that this time we then have access now to run the virtual environment.

124
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:51,240
‫So you can see here at the start of this command line I have VM V and that indicates the fact that I'm

125
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,120
‫now working in the virtual environment.

126
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,430
‫So step one is to create a virtual environment.

127
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,460
‫Step two is always then to activate it.

128
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:06,940
‫So before you start working on your project, you need to make sure that you access or activate sorry,

129
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,630
‫the virtual environment.

130
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,260
‫So we can deactivate the environment.

131
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:19,730
‫So if I press up to bring up the previous command, press D and then press tab to finish stuff off the

132
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,660
‫command line there, press enter.

133
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,540
‫You can see that that does not deactivate the virtual environment.

134
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:33,350
‫So if I just close the window and then I open up again, you can see by doing that I then deactivated

135
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,700
‫the virtual environment.

136
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,450
‫So.

137
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,600
‫That's how to activate and then potentially deactivate the virtual environment.

138
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:47,260
‫There are other variations here, but that's just a quick and simple way of working, similar to overcoming

139
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,770
‫the problem that we have previously.

140
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:55,090
‫There are many different variations of performing and working in a way that kind of avoids that problem.

141
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:58,720
‫But I've just shown you one of many ways that is possible.

142
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:05,890
‫So again, I do recommend that you spend a little bit of time, maybe five, 10 minutes, just familiarizing

143
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:11,050
‫yourself with that process, starting, stopping, maybe make some notes regarding the commands that

144
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:16,390
‫you need because you are going to pretty much create a virtual environment or start a virtual environment

145
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:21,400
‫every time you work with a Python application, specifically Django applications.
