00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,610
‫In this tutorial, we're going to install Python onto the Windows operating system.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:11,100
‫The burning question here is probably why do I need to install Python?

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:18,280
‫The whole point of downloading Python is that it provides us all the tools that allows the computer

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:25,960
‫to interact with the Python programming language so that it can execute our code or run our code.

5
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,470
‫This is Windows 11.

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:35,090
‫This process should work on Windows ten so you can follow along if you're running Windows ten or 11.

7
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,140
‫So here I have a fresh installation of Windows 11.

8
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:45,880
‫So let's go ahead and open up a browser window, gave it to Google and let's type in Python download.

9
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:51,700
‫So there is only one place where we want to download Python safely, and that is the Python website.

10
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,510
‫So let's head over to Python dot org.

11
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,020
‫You can go there directly and let's go over to downloads.

12
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:03,250
‫So you can see by default when you navigate your land on the page, we are presented with the Python

13
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,800
‫download and that is the latest version.

14
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,490
‫So for this course I am running 3.9.5.

15
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:15,130
‫But if you're running windows you can run any version of Python from about 3.4.

16
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,210
‫So let's head over to the download section.

17
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,090
‫Let's go to Windows and have a look at the different options here.

18
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,840
‫Now, we've already noticed that there are different versions of Python.

19
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:33,080
‫Python is a very proactive language which is constantly being updated, although at the moment that's

20
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,190
‫not necessarily an important factor.

21
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:40,310
‫But later along the line in your development, you may be working with legacy software.

22
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,370
‫That software may be written with older versions of Python, so you may have a need in the future to

23
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:51,800
‫download different versions and use different versions of Python when developing applications.

24
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,130
‫For this course.

25
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:59,140
‫All the examples are demonstrated utilizing Python 3.9.5.

26
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:03,880
‫And although I suggested that that isn't necessarily an issue if you're running later or earlier versions

27
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:09,190
‫of Python for this particular course, if you do want to follow along and download that version, let's

28
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:15,370
‫go ahead and search this page here for 3.9.5 and download the correct version.

29
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,350
‫Okay, So clicking on the link here, we're presented with a few different options at the bottom here

30
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:24,040
‫we can download the 64 bit or 32 bit option.

31
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,960
‫Now, if you're running in a computer that's been purchased over the last ten years, then the likelihood

32
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,840
‫is that you're running a 64 bit machine.

33
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,660
‫So you go ahead and download 64 bit.

34
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,980
‫Once you've downloaded Python, let's just go ahead and open the file.

35
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:44,720
‫It will be downloaded, no doubt to the download folder if you don't have this particular operating

36
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,360
‫system.

37
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,940
‫So here we present you with two options Install now and customize installation.

38
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:56,900
‫The first option that you should select is to add Python 3.9 to path.

39
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:03,260
‫So by adding Python to PATH, it makes it possible for you to run or use python from your command prompt.

40
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,700
‫And that's something that we want to do.

41
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,970
‫So let's make sure we add and select that option.

42
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:14,240
‫Secondly, I just want to customize where we are going to actually install Python, because for example,

43
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,980
‫here you can see that it's going to be installed in this location here, but potentially that isn't

44
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:25,760
‫necessarily a very convenient place where I want to actually store the Python installation, because

45
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,430
‫if I've got multiple versions of Python, maybe I want to be able to easily access those different versions.

46
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:36,290
‫So I like to install Python directly onto the C drive so we can ignore this list here.

47
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,650
‫We can install everything that isn't a problem for this particular course.

48
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:44,930
‫So I press next and then here customize the installation I'm just going to remove.

49
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:53,990
‫Everything and then make sure that then that is then installed onto the C drive in a folder called Python

50
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,420
‫three nine referencing the version of Python.

51
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,050
‫So you can decide if you want to install for all users.

52
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:04,820
‫But like I said, there's not really anything else here that we need to consider for this particular

53
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,120
‫course.

54
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,460
‫So you can just go ahead now and install.

55
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,320
‫So do you want to make changes?

56
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:09,950
‫Yes.

57
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,300
‫So once we're finished, we're told it was successful, so everything should be absolutely fine.

58
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,510
‫So we just close that.

59
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:19,810
‫Installer.

60
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,310
‫Looks like I've opened it up twice now.

61
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:28,270
‫If you do have any problems with installing Python, then head over to Stack Overflow if you haven't

62
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,850
‫been introduced or seen Stack Overflow before.

63
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,750
‫It is a service whereby you can ask technical questions.

64
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:40,330
‫If you're having problems with a software installation, maybe you're having problems with some code

65
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,340
‫that you're working on.

66
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:47,350
‫Then definitely have a look at Stack Overflow because generally 99% of the time, the problems that

67
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:50,290
‫you're experiencing, someone else has already experienced those.

68
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,320
‫So it's likely to be a resolution for that problem here.

69
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:59,810
‫So let's just check that python has been installed so we can go over to start.

70
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,770
‫Let's type in the word command.

71
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:07,040
‫That should bring up the command prompt here or give us the option to open up the command prompt and

72
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,320
‫then from inside the command prompt.

73
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,890
‫Well, open that from inside the command prompt.

74
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:19,640
‫I'm going to type in P for Python space, dash, dash and then version.

75
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:25,460
‫So that's going to tell me that Python 3.95 is now installed on the computer.

76
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:32,890
‫With Python now installed, we're now ready to develop and execute or run our applications in Python.
